						Born with a personal vision in 2024, College Kinnect was
						created by a forward-thinking student at Virginia
						Commonwealth University. Frustrated by missed
						opportunities and the challenge of finding like-minded
						peers, our founder set out to revolutionize how fellow
						students engage with their campus and each other.
						College Kinnect is more than just an app; it's a
						movement towards a more connected, active, and
						fulfilling college experience. Our platform stands as a
						testament to the power of community, innovation, and the
						relentless pursuit of growth.
